# COVID and Population Density
This is the second of two projects developed for the course Data Science as a Field (DTSA-5301) at University of Colorado Boulder.

## Description
The project investigates the relationship between population density and the spread of COVID-19. The hypothesis is that COVID initially spread faster through densely populated counties in the U.S. than through less densely populated ones, but that this correlation should disappear over time, as COVID 

## Key Features:
* **Data Collection**: Combines COVID-19 case and mortality data with population density statistics.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Employs statistical methods to assess correlations between population density and COVID-19 case and fatality numbers.
* **Visualization**: Generates charts and maps to illustrate the relationship between population density and the spread of COVID-19.

## Results

![Population Density and COVID](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f223dda-edb4-4454-bbcf-1d36f3305f59)

As can be seen in the graph, there was a certain correlation between population density and COVID cases/deaths at the beginning of the pandemic, but the correlation was weaker than I had expected. As I hypothesized, the correlation eventually disappeared.
